# Virkea Developer Primer

This guide is the handbook for Virkea developers, it is created for an important purpose and that is to make Virkea development autonomous.

## Autonomous Development 

### Why is Autonomous Development Imporant?

To answer that question, we have to answer another question first:

  > Why increasing number of developers does not equal faster development?

That is because: if we want to achieve faster development by increasing number of developers, more task should be done **in parallel**. And that means we have to split large task into smaller tasks and ensure those smaller tasks can be done in parallel. Why in parallel? because most companies practice normal office hour therefore eventhough you increase number of developers, most of them are only active during the same time (8-5) 

To ensure everything running smoothly for above scenario is not an easy feat, it is especially harder when team become larger. I identified at least two important factors, to make it happen:
- You need technical person(s), whose main job is to organize, split and assign those tasks
- You need team with autonomous mindset, but adhere to certain conventions, rules and standards.

Autonomous mindset is important to ensure many tasks can be done in parallel and to avoid developers blocking each other out. However conventions, rules and standards must still be enforced so that the project is still coherent and to make it possible for developers to help each other as necessary (uniformity means every developers can understand every codes even when they aren't the author)

### How to Achieve Autonomous Development

To gain autonomy, you need two things:
- Clear goal
- Convention (A.K.A rules)

While 'clear goal' is understandable enough, convention isn't. So let's define what our conventions will be:
- Style Guide  
- Test (Unit, Integration)  
- Continuous Integration (CI) and Continous Development (CD)

## Style Guide

Style guide is important for: 
- Readability  
- Maintainability  
- Consistency

Our style guide will be consisted of these following documents:
- A style guide for every development language (Ruby, JS, etc)
- A platform guide for each backend and frontend (or other subsystem) development
